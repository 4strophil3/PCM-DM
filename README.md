# PCM-DM:
Consider the message signal m(t) = - cos(250πt) + sin(70πt). Use MATLAB, Python, or C to complete the following
tasks:
# Task 1: Pulse Code Modulation (5 points):
Consider the message signal m(t) for the time interval (0,2) seconds.
Obtain the pulse code modulated binary sequence if the signal is sampled at 50% higher than the Nyquist sample rate
and L= 64 quantization levels are used. You can start labeling the quantization labels from the top. The first sample is
taken at t = 0. Your code should display the binary representation of the first 10 samples on the screen, in the format
“0110011-1010010-. . . ”.
# Task 2: Delta Modulation (5 points):
Consider the message signal m(t) for the time interval (0,2) seconds. Obtain
the delta modulated binary sequence if the signal is sampled at six times the Nyquist sample rate. The first sample is
taken at t = 0. Your code should display the binary representation of the first 20 samples on the screen.
